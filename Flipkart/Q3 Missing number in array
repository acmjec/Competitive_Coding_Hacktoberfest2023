Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106
